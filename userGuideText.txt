Description
The Keysight E3631A power supply features a combination of programming 
capabilities and linear power supply performance that makes it ideal for power 
systems applications. The triple power supply delivers 0 to ± 25 V outputs rated at 0 
to 1 A and 0 to +6 V output rated at 0 to 5 A. The ± 25Vsupplies also provide 0 to ± 
25 V tracking output to power operational amplifiers and circuits requiring 
symmetrically balanced voltages. The 0 to ± 25V outputs track each other within 
±(0.2% output + 20 mV) in the track  mode. The ± 25V outputs can also be used in 
series as a single 0 to 50 V/1 A supply.
The voltage and current of each supply can be adjusted independently from the front 
panel or programmed over the GPIB or RS-232 interface. Using the front panel keys 
and the control knob, you can adjust the voltage and current of a selected output; 
enable or disable track mode; store and recall operating states; enable or disable three 
outputs; calibrate the power supply including changing the calibration security; return 
the power supply to local operating mode; and configure the power supply for remote 
interface operation.
From the front-panel VFD (vacuum-fluorescent display), you can monitor actual 
values of output voltage and current (meter mode) or voltage and current limit values 
(limit mode), check the operating status of the power supply from the annunciators, 
and check the type of error from the displayed error codes (messages).
When operated over the remote interface, the power supply can be both a listener and 
a talker. Using an external controller, you can instruct the power supply to set outputs 
and to send the status data back over the GPIB or RS-232. Readback capabilities 
include reading back output voltage and current; present and stored status; and error 
messages. The following functions are implemented over the GPIB or RS-232:

• Voltage and current programming
• Voltage and current readback
• Enable or disable track mode
• Present and stored status readback
• Programming syntax error detection
• Voltage and current calibration
• Output on or off
• Self-test

Chapter 1 General Information
Description



The front panel includes a VFD for displaying the output voltage and current. Two 
4-digit voltage and current meters accurately show the actual or limit values of a 
selected supply simultaneously. Three meter selection keys choose the voltage and 
current of any one output to be monitored on the display.
Connections to the power supply's output and to chassis ground are made to binding 
posts on the front panel. The +25V and -25V supply's outputs share a common output 
terminal which is isolated from chassis ground. The positive and negative terminals 
of each output can be grounded, or each output can be kept within ±240 Vdc from the 
chassis ground. The power supply is shipped with a detachable, 3-wire grounding 
type power cord. The ac line fuse is an extractor type on the rear panel.
The power supply can be calibrated from the front panel directly or with a controller 
over the GPIB or RS-232 interface using calibration commands. Correction factors 
are stored in non-volatile memory and are used during output programming. 
Calibration from the front panel or a controller eliminates the need to remove the top 
cover or even the need to remove the power supply from your system cabinet. You 
can guard against unauthorized calibration by using the “Secured” calibration 
protection function.

Initial Inspection
When you receive your power supply, inspect it for any obvious damage that may 
have occurred during shipment. If any damage is found, notify the carrier and the 
nearest Keysight Sales Office immediately. Warranty information is shown in the front 
of this manual.
Keep the original packing materials in case the power supply has to be returned to 
Keysight Technologies in the future. If you return the power supply for service, attach 
a tag identifying the owner and model number. Also include a brief description of the 
problem.
Mechanical Check
This check confirms that there are no broken keys or knob, that the cabinet and panel 
surfaces are free of dents and scratches, and that the display is not scratched or cracked.
Electrical Check
Chapter 2 describes an initial operation procedure which, when successfully 
completed, verifies to a high level of confidence that the power supply is operating 
in accordance with its specifications. Detailed electrical verification procedures are 
included in the Service Guide.

Cooling and Location
Cooling
The power supply can operate without loss of performance within the temperature 
range of 0 °C to 40 °C, and with derated output current from 40 °C to 55 °C. A fan 
cools the power supply by drawing air through the rear panel and exhausting it out 
the sides. Using a Keysight rack mount will not impede the flow of air.
Bench Operation
Your power supply must be installed in a location that allows sufficient space at the 
sides and rear of the power supply for adequate air circulation. The rubber bumpers 
must be removed for rack mounting.

Input Power Requirements



Input Power Requirements
You can operate your power supply from a nominal 100 V, 115 V, or 230 V single 
phase ac power source at 47 to 63 Hz. An indication on the rear panel shows the 
nominal input voltage set for the power supply at the factory. If necessary, you can 
change the power-line voltage setting according to the instructions on the next page.

Power-Line Cord
The power supply is shipped from the factory with a power-line cord that has a plug 
appropriate for your location. Contact the nearest Keysight Sales and Service Office 
if the wrong power-line cord is included with your power supply. Your power supply 
is equipped with a 3-wire grounding type power cord; the third conductor being the 
ground. The power supply is grounded only when the power-line cord is plugged into 
an appropriate receptacle. Do not operate your power supply without adequate cabinet 
ground connection.

Power-Line Voltage Selection
Power-line voltage selection is accomplished by adjusting two components: 
power-line voltage selector and power-line fuse on the power-line module of the rear 
panel. To change the power-line voltage, proceed as follows:

Front-Panel Operation Overview

Front-Panel Operation Overview

The following section describes an overview of the front-panel keys before operating 
your power supply.
• The power supply is shipped from the factory configured in the front-panel 

operation mode. At power-on, the power supply is automatically set to operate 
in the front-panel operation mode. When in this mode, the front-panel keys can 
be used. When the power supply is in remote operation mode, you can return to 
front-panel operation mode at any time by pressing the 
 key if you did 
not previously send the front-panel lockout command. A change between front-
panel and remote operation modes will not result in a change in the output 
parameters.

• When you press the 

Display Limit

 key (the Lmt annunciator blinks), the display 

of the power supply goes to the limit mode and the present limit values of the 
selected supply will be displayed. In this mode, you can also observe the change 
of the limit values when adjusting the knob. If you press the 
 key 
again or let the display time-out after several seconds, the power supply will return 
the display to the meter mode (the Lmt annunciator turns off). In this mode, the 
actual output voltage and current will be displayed.

Display Limit

• All outputs of the power supply can be enabled or disabled from the front panel 
 key. When the output of the power supply is off, the 

using the 
OFF annunciator turns on and the three outputs are disabled.

Output On/Off

• The display provides the present operating status of the power supply with 

annunciators and also informs the user of error codes. For example, the +6V supply 
is operating in CV mode and controlled from the front panel, then the CV and +6V 
annunciators will turn on. If, however, the power supply is remotely controlled, 
the Rmt annunciator will also turn on, and when the power supply is being 
addressed over GPIB interface, the Adrs annunciator will turn on. See ‘‘Display 
Annunciators’’ on page 6 for more information.

Chapter 3 Front-Panel Operation
Tracking Operation



Tracking Operation

The ±25V supplies provide 0 to ±25 V tracking outputs. In the track mode, two 
voltages of the ±25V supplies track each other within ±(0.2% output +20 mV) for 
convenience in varying the symmetrical voltages needed by operational amplifiers 
and other circuits using balanced positive and negative inputs. The state of track mode 
is stored in volatile memory; the track is always off state when power has been off or 
after a remote interface reset.
To operate the power supply in the track mode, proceed as follows:

1 Set the +25V supply to the desired voltage as described in previous section 

“Constant Voltage Operation”(see page 38 for detailed information).

Track

2 Enable the track mode.

Track

key must be depressed for at least 1 second to enable the track mode. 

The 
When the track mode is first enabled, the -25V supply will be set to the same voltage 
level as the +25V supply. Once enabled, any change of the voltage level in either the 
+25V supply or the -25V supply will be reflected in other supply. The current limit 
is independently set for each of the +25V or the -25V supply and is not affected by 
the track mode.

3 Verify that the ±25V supplies track each other properly.

You can verify that the voltage of the -25V supply tracks that of the +25V supply 
within ±(0.2% of output + 20 mV) from the front-panel display by comparing the 
voltage values of the +25V supply and the -25V supply.

In the track mode, if the CC annunciator is lit when the display is selected for the 
+25V supply, choose a higher current limit for the +25V supply. 
If the CC annunciator is lit when the display is selected for the -25V supply, 
choose a higher current limit for the -25V supply.

Chapter 3 Front-Panel Operation
Storing and Recalling Operating States

Storing and Recalling Operating States

You can store up to three different operating states in non-volatile memory. This also 
enables you to recall the entire instrument configuration with just a few key presses 
from the front panel.
The memory locations are supplied from the factory for front panel operation with 
the following states: display and knob selection for +6V output; *RST values of 
voltage and current limits for three outputs; output disabled; and track off state. 
*RST values for +6V supply are 0 V and 5 A and 0 V and 1 A for the ±25V supplies.
The following steps show you how to store and recall an operating state.

1 Set up the power supply for the desired operating state.

The storage feature “remembers” the display and knob selection state, the 
limit values of voltage and current for three outputs, output on/off state, and track on/
off state.

System-Related Operations

This section gives information on topics such as self-test, error conditions, and front-
panel display control. This information is not directly related to setting up the power 
supply but is an important part of operating the power supply.

Self-Test
A power-on self-test occurs automatically when you turn on the power supply. This 
test assures you that the power supply is operational. This test does not perform the 
extensive set of tests that are included as part of the complete self-test described below. 
If the power-on self-test fails, the ERROR annunciator turns on. 

• A complete self-test performs a series of tests and takes approximately 2 seconds to 

execute. If all tests pass, you can have a high confidence that the power supply is 
operational.
If the complete self-test is successful, “PASS” is displayed on the front panel. If the 
self-test fails, “FAIL” is displayed and the ERROR annunciator turns on. See the 
Service Guide for instructions on returning the power supply to Keysight 
Technologies for service.

• Front-panel operation:

The complete self-test is enabled by pressing the 
keys except the

Error Conditions
When the front-panel ERROR annunciator turns on, one or more command syntax or 
hardware errors have been detected. A record of up to 20 errors can be stored in the 
power supply's error queue. See “Error Messages” on page 115. for a complete listing 
of the errors. 

•

• Errors are retrieved in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The first error returned is the 

first error that was stored. When you have read all errors from the queue, the 
ERROR annunciator turns off. The power supply beeps once each time an error is 
generated.
If more than 20 errors have occurred when you operate the power supply over the 
remote interface, the last error stored in the queue (the most recent error) is replaced 
with -350, “Queue overflow”. No additional errors are stored until you remove 
errors from the queue. If no errors have occurred when you read the error queue, the 
power supply responds with +0, “No error” over the remote interface or “NO 
ERRORS” from the front panel.

• The error queue is cleared when power has been off or after a *CLS (clear status) 
command has been executed. The *RST (reset) command does not clear the error 
queue.

• Front-panel operation:

If the ERROR annunciator is on, press the 
stored in the queue. All errors are cleared when you read all errors.

Display Control
For security reasons, you may want to turn off the front-panel display. From the remote 
interface, you can display a 12-character message on the front panel.
The display can be enabled / disabled from the remote interface only.

• When the display is turned off, outputs are not sent to the display and all annunciators 

are disabled except the ERROR annunciator. Front-panel operation is otherwise 
unaffected by turning off the display.

• The display state is stored in volatile memory; the display is always enabled when 
power has been off, after a remote interface reset, or after returning to local from 
remote. 

• You can display a message on the front panel by sending a command from the remote 

interface. The power supply can display up to 12 characters of the message on the 
front panel; any additional characters are truncated. Commas, periods, and semicolons 
share a display space with the preceding character, and are not considered individual 
characters. When a message is displayed, outputs are not sent to the display.

• Sending a message to the display from the remote interface overrides the display state; 

this means that you can display a message even if the display is turned off.
The display state is automatically turned on when you return to the local (front panel) 
operation. Press the 
 key to return to the local state from the remote interface

Remote Interface Configuration

Before you can operate the power supply over the remote interface, you must 
configure the power supply for the remote interface. This section gives information 
on configuring the remote interface. For additional information on programming the 
power supply over the remote interface, See chapter 4 “Remote Interface Reference”,  
starting on page 65.

Remote Interface Selection
The power supply is shipped with both an GPIB (IEEE-488) interface and an RS-232 
interface on the rear panel. Only one interface can be enabled at a time. The GPIB 
interface is selected when the power supply is shipped from the factory.
The remote interface can be selected from the front-panel only.
• The interface selection is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not change when 

power has been off or after a remote interface reset.
If you select the GPIB interface, you must select a unique address for the power 
supply. The current address is displayed momentarily on the front panel when you 
turn on the power supply.1

•

• Your GPIB bus controller has its own address. Be sure to avoid using the bus 

controller’s address for any instrument on the interface bus. Keysight Technologies 
controllers generally use address “21”.
If you enable the RS-232 interface, you must select the baud rate and parity to be 
used. “RS-232” is displayed momentarily on the front panel when you turn on the 
power supply if you have selected this interface.2

•

1Refer to "GPIB Interface Configuration" starting on page 55 for more information on 
connecting the power supply to a computer over the GPIB interface.

Baud Rate Selection (RS-232)
You can select one of six baud rates for RS-232 operation. The rate is set to 9600 baud 
when the power supply is shipped from the factory. 
The baud rate can be set from the front-panel only.
• Select one of the following: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600 baud. The factory 

setting is 9600 baud.

• The baud rate selection is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not change 

when power has been off or after a remote interface reset.

Parity Selection (RS-232)
You can select the parity for RS-232 operation. The power supply is configured for 
no parity and 8 data bits when shipped from the factory.
The parity can be set from the front-panel only.
• Select one of the following: None (8 data bits), Even (7 data bits), or Odd (7 data 
bits). When you set the parity, you are indirectly setting the number of data bits.

GPIB Interface Configuration

GPIB Interface Configuration

The GPIB connector on the rear panel connects your power supply to the computer 
and other GPIB devices. Chapter 1 lists the cables that are available from Keysight 
Technologies. An GPIB system can be connected together in any configuration (star, 
linear, or both) as long as the following rules are observed:
• The total number of devices including the computer is no more than 15.
• The total length of all the cables used is no more than 2 meter times the number 

of devices connected together, up to a maximum of 20 meters.

3

N o t e    

IEEE-488 states that you should exercise caution if your individual cable lengths 
exceed 4 meters

Do not stack more than three connector blocks together on any GPIB connector. Make 
sure that all connectors are fully seated and that the lock screws are firmly finger 
tightened.

Chapter 3 Front-Panel Operation
RS-232 Interface Configuration



RS-232 Interface Configuration

You connect the power supply to the RS-232 interface using the 9-pin (DB-9) serial 
connector on the rear panel. The power supply is configured as a DTE (Data Terminal 
Equipment) device. For all communications over the RS-232 interface, the power 
supply uses two handshake lines: DTR (Data Terminal Ready, on pin 4) and DSR 
(Data Set Ready, on pin 6).
The following sections contain information to help you use the power supply over the 
RS-232 interface. The programming commands for RS-232 are explained on page 89. 

RS-232 Configuration Overview
Configure the RS-232 interface using the parameters shown below. Use the front-
panel 
 key to select the baud rate, parity, and number of data bits (see 
page 53 for more information to configure from the front panel).

I/O Config

• Baud Rate: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, or 9600 baud (factory setting)
• Parity and Data Bits:

None / 8 data bits (factory setting)
Even / 7 data bits, or
Odd / 7 data bits
1 bit (fixed)
2 bits (fixed) 

• Number of Start Bits:
• Number of Stop Bits:

RS-232 Data Frame Format
A character frame consists of all the transmitted bits that make up a single character. 
The frame is defined as the characters from the start bit to the last stop bit, inclusively. 
Within the frame, you can select the baud rate, number of data bits, and parity type. 
The power supply uses the following frame formats for seven and eight data bits. 

56



Chapter 3 Front-Panel Operation
RS-232 Interface Configuration

Connection to a Computer or Terminal
To connect the power supply to a computer or terminal, you must have the proper 
interface cable. Most computers and terminals are DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) 
devices. Since the power supply is also a DTE device, you must use a DTE-to-DTE 
interface cable. These cables are also called null-modem, modem-eliminator, or 
crossover cables.
The interface cable must also have the proper connector on each end and the internal 
wiring must be correct. Connectors typically have 9 pins (DB-9 connector) or 25 
pins (DB-25 connector) with a “male” or “female” pin configuration. A male 
connector has pins inside the connector shell and a female connector has holes 
inside the connector shell.
If you cannot find the correct cable for your configuration, you may have to use a 
wiring adapter. If you are using a DTE-to-DTE cable, make sure the adapter is a 
“straight-through” type. Typical adapters include gender changers, null-modem 
adapters, and DB-9 to DB-25 adapters.
The cable and adapter diagrams shown below can be used to connect the power supply 
to most computers or terminals. If your configuration is different than those described, 
order the Keysight 34399A, 34399A Adapter Kit. This kit contains adapters for 
connection to other computers, terminals, and modems. Instructions and pin diagrams 
are included with the adapter kit.
DB-9 Serial Connection  If your computer or terminal has a 9-pin serial port with a 
male connector, use the null-modem cable included with the Keysight 34398A Cable 
Kit. This cable has a 9-pin female connector on each end. The cable pin diagram is 
shown below.

DTR/DSR Handshake Protocol 
The power supply is configured as a DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) device and uses 
the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) and DSR (Data Set Ready)  lines of the RS-232 
interface to handshake. The power supply uses the DTR line to send a hold-off signal. 
The DTR line must be TRUE before the power supply will accept data from the 
interface. When the power supply sets the DTR line FALSE, the data must cease 
within 10 characters.
To disable the DTR/DSR handshake, do not connect the DTR line and tie the DSR 
line to logic TRUE. If you disable the DTR/DSR handshake, also select a slower baud 
rate to ensure that the data is transmitted correctly.
The power supply sets the DTR line FALSE in the following cases:

1 When the power supply’s input buffer is full (when approximately 100 characters 
have been received), it sets the DTR line FALSE (pin 4 on the RS-232 connector). 
When enough characters have been removed to make space in the input buffer, the 
power supply sets the DTR line TRUE, unless the second case (see next) prevents this.

58



Chapter 3 Front-Panel Operation
RS-232 Interface Configuration

2 When the power supply wants to “talk” over the interface (which means that it has 
processed a query) and has received a <new line> message terminator, it will set the 
DTR line FALSE. This implies that once a query has been sent to the power supply, 
the bus controller should read the response before attempting to send more data. It 
also means that a <new line> must terminate the command string. After the response 
has been output, the power supply sets the DTR line TRUE again, unless the first case 
(see above) prevents this. 
The power supply monitors the DSR line to determine when the bus controller is 
ready to accept data over the interface. The power supply monitors the DSR line 
(pin 6 on the RS-232 connector) before each character is sent. The output is 
suspended if the DSR line is FALSE. When the DSR line goes TRUE, transmission 
will resume.
The power supply holds the DTR line FALSE while output is suspended. A form 
of interface deadlock exists until the bus controller asserts the DSR line TRUE to 
allow the power supply to complete the transmission. You can break the interface 
deadlock by sending the <Ctrl-C> character, which clears the operation in progress 
and discards pending output (this is equivalent to the IEEE-488 device clear action). 

For the <Ctrl-C> character to be recognized reliably by the power supply while it 
holds DTR FALSE, the bus controller must first set DSR FALSE.

3

RS-232 Troubleshooting
Here are a few things to check if you are having problems communicating over the 
RS-232 interface. If you need additional help, refer to the documentation that came 
with your computer.
• Verify that the power supply and your computer are configured for the same baud 
rate, parity, and number of data bits. Make sure that your computer is set up for 1 
start bit and 2 stop bits (these values are fixed on the power supply).

• Make sure to execute the SYSTem:REMote command to place the power supply 

in the remote mode.

• Verify that you have connected the correct interface cable and adapters. Even if 
the cable has the proper connectors for your system, the internal wiring may be 
incorrect. The Keysight 34398A Cable Kit can be used to connect the power supply 
to most computers or terminals.

• Verify that you have connected the interface cable to the correct serial port on your 

computer (COM1, COM2, etc.).

Calibration Overview

This section gives an overview of the calibration features of the power supply. For 
more detailed discussion of the calibration procedures, see the Service Guide.

Calibration Security
This feature allows you to enter a security code to prevent accidental or unauthorized 
calibrations of the power supply. When you first receive your power supply, it is 
secured. Before you can calibrate the power supply, you must unsecure it by entering 
the correct security code.
• The security code is set to “HP003631” when the power supply is shipped from 

the factory. The security code is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not 
change when power has been off or after a remote interface reset.

• To secure the power supply from the remote interface, the security code may 

contain up to 12 alphanumeric characters as shown below. The first character must 
be a letter, but the remaining characters can be letters or numbers. You do not have 
to use all 12 characters but the first character must always be a letter.

A _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _    (12 characters)   

• To secure the power supply from the remote interface so that it can be unsecured 
from the front panel, use the eight-character format shown below. The first two 
characters must be “H P” and the remaining characters must be numbers. Only the 
last six characters are recognized from the front panel, but all eight characters are 
required. To unsecure the power supply from the front panel, omit the “H P” and 
enter the remaining numbers as shown on the following 

H P   _  _  _  _  _  _    (8 characters)

If you forget your security code, you can disable the security feature by adding a 
jumper inside the power supply, and then entering a new code. See the Service 
Guide for more information.

Calibration Overview



Calibration Count 
You can determine the number of times that your power supply has been  calibrated. 
Your power supply was calibrated before it left the factory. When you receive your 
power supply, read the count to determine its initial value.
The calibration count feature can be performed from the remote interface only.
• The calibration count is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not change when 

power has been off or after a remote interface reset.

• The calibration count increments up to a maximum of 32,767 after which it wraps-

around to 0. Since the value increments by one for each calibration point, a 
complete calibration will increase the value by 6 counts. 

• Remote Interface Operation:
   CALibrate:COUNt?

Calibration Message
You can use the calibration message feature to record calibration information about 
your power supply. For example, you can store such information as the last calibration 
date, the next calibration due date, the power supply's serial number, or even the name 
and phone number of the person to contact for a new calibration.
You can record and read information in the calibration message from the remote 
interface only.
• The power supply should be unsecured before sending a calibration message.
• The calibration message may contain up to 40 characters.
• The calibration message is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not change 

when power has been off or after a remote interface reset.

• Remote Interface Operation:
   CALibrate:STRing <quoted string> 
The following command string shows how to store a calibration message.
   "CAL:STR 'CAL 05-1-95'"

Simplified Programming Overview

This section gives an overview of the basic techniques used to program the power 
supply over the remote interface. This section is only an overview and does not give 
all of the details you will need to write your own application programs. Refer to the 
remainder of this chapter and also chapter 6, Application Programs, for more details 
and examples. Also refer to the programming reference manual that came with your 
computer for details on outputting command strings and entering data.

Using the APPLy Command
The APPLy command provides the most straightforward method to program the 
power supply over the remote interface. For example, the following statement 
executed from your computer will set the +6V supply to an output of 3 V rated at 1 A:
  "APPL P6V, 3.0, 1.0"

Using the Low-Level Commands
Although the APPLy command provides the most straightforward method to program 
the power supply, the low-level commands give you more flexibility to change 
individual parameters. For example, the following statements executed from your 
computer will set the +6V supply to an output of 3 V rated at 1 A:
  "INST P6V"
  "VOLT 3.0"
  "CURR 1.0"

Set output voltage to 3.0 V

Select +6V output

Set output current to 1.0 A

72



Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
Simplified Programming Overview

Reading a Query Response 
Only the query commands (commands that end with “?”) will instruct the power 
supply to send a response message. Queries return either output values or internal 
instrument settings. For example, the following statements executed from your 
computer will read the power supply's error queue and print the most recent error:
  dimension statement
  "SYST:ERR?"
  bus enter statement
  print statement

Dimension string array (80 elements)
Read error queue
Enter error string into computer
Print error string

Selecting a Trigger Source
The power supply will accept a “bus” (software) trigger or an immediate internal 
trigger as a trigger source. By default, the “BUS” trigger source is selected. If you 
want the power supply to use an immediate internal trigger, you must select 
“IMMediate”. For example, the following statements executed from your 
computer will set the +6V supply to an output of 3 V/1 A immediately:
  "INST P6V"
  "VOLT:TRIG 3.0"
  "CURR:TRIG 1.0"
  "TRIG:SOUR IMM"
  "INIT"

Select the +6V output
Set the triggered voltage level to 3.0 V

Cause the trigger system to initiate 

Set the triggered current level to 1.0 A

Select the immediate trigger as a source

Programming Ranges and Output Identifiers
Output setting commands require a parameter for programming ranges and an output 
name or an output number as the identifier of each output and most queries will return 
a parameter. The programming range for a parameter varies according to the selected 
output of the power supply. The following table lists the programming ranges, output 
names, and output numbers for each output.
Refer to this table to identify parameters when programming the power supply.

Using the APPLy Command

Using the APPLy Command
The APPLy command provides the most straightforward method to program the 
power supply over the remote interface. You can select the specific output, output 
voltage, and output current all in one command. 

APPLy
{P6V|P25V|N25V}[,{<voltage>| DEF|MIN|MAX}[,{<current>|DEF|MIN|MAX}]]
This command is combination of INSTrument:SELect, [SOURce:] VOLTage, 
and [SOURce:]CURRent commands. The values of voltage and the current of the 
specified output are changed as soon as the command is executed. 
You can identify each output by the output name (P6V, P25V or N25V) as described 
in Table 4-1. For the voltage and current parameters of the APPLy command, the 
ranges depend on the output currently selected. You can substitute “MINimum”, 
“MAXimum”, or “DEFault” in place of a specific value for the voltage and current 
parameters. MIN selects the lowest voltage and current values allowed for the 
selected output. MAX selects the highest voltage and current values allowed. The 
default voltage values are 0 volts for all outputs. The default current values are 5 
A for +6V output and 1 A for ±25V outputs. The default voltage and current values 
are exactly the same as the *RST values.  See Table 4-1 for details of parameters.
If you specify only one value for the parameter, the power supply regards it as voltage 
setting value. If you do not specify any value for the parameter, the APPLy command 
only selects the output specified and acts as the INSTrument command.
APPLy? [{P6V|P25V|N25V}]
This command queries the power supply's present voltage and current values for each 
output and returns a quoted string. The voltage and current are returned in sequence 
as shown in the sample string below (the quotation marks are returned as part of the 
string). If any output identifier is not specified, the voltage and the current of the 
currently selected output are returned.
    "5.000000,1.000000"
In the above string, the first number 5.000000 is the voltage limit value and the second 
number 1.000000 is the current limit value for the specified output.

Output Setting and Operation Commands

This section describes the low-level commands used to program the power supply. 
Although the APPLy command provides the most straightforward method to program 
the power supply, the low-level commands give you more flexibility to change 
individual parameters.
See page 74 for programming ranges, output identifiers, and MIN / MAX values in 
the following commands.

Output Selection Commands
INSTrument[:SELect] {P6V|P25V|N25V}
This command selects the output to be programmed among three outputs by the output 
identifier. The outputs of the power supply are considered three logical instruments. 
The INSTrument command provides a mechanism to identify and select an output. 
When one output is selected, the other outputs are unavailable for programming until 
selected. The commands which are affected by the INSTrument command are 
output setting commands (SOURce), measurement commands (MEASure), and 
calibration commands (CALibration). “P6V” is the identifier for +6V output, 
“P25V” is for +25V output and “N25V” is for -25V output.

INSTrument[:SELect]?
This query returns the currently selected output by the INSTrument [:SELect] 
or INSTrument:NSELect command. The returned parameter is “P6V”, “P25V”, 
or “N25V”.

INSTrument:NSELect {1|2|3}
This command selects the output to be programmed among three outputs by a numeric 
value instead of the output identifier used in the INSTrument [:SELect] 
command. “1” selects +6V output, “2” selects +25V output, and “3” selects -25V 
output.

INSTrument:NSELect?
This query returns the currently selected output by the INSTrument:NSELect or 
INSTrument[:SELect] command. The returned parameter is “1” for +6V output, 
“2” for +25V output or “3” for -25V output.

76



Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
Output Setting and Operation Commands

INSTrument:COUPle[:TRIGger] {ALL|NONE |<list>}
This command defines a coupling between various logical outputs of the power 
supply. The couple command consists of an optional subsystem node followed by a 
single parameter. The only valid parameter for the optional subsystem node is 
TRIGger subsystem. If no node follows the couple command, TRIGger subsystem 
is assumed to be coupled. 
The parameter indicates to which logical outputs the specified coupling is to apply. 
“ALL” indicates that specified coupling is to apply to all outputs. “NONE” indicates 
that specified coupling is to be removed. A list of outputs specifies a particular set of 
logical outputs to be coupled. At *RST, all outputs are uncoupled. Notice that TRACk 
must be off before the ±25V supplies can be coupled.

4

The following program segment shows how to use the INSTrument:COUPle 
command to couple two outputs between the +6V and the +25V outputs with 
voltage and current triggered levels. The power supply is set to the newly 
programmed values as set by the VOLTage:TRIGgered and 
CURRent:TRIGgered commands.
   "INST:SEL P6V"
   "VOLT:TRIG 5"
   "CURR:TRIG 3"
   "INST:SEL P25V"
   "VOLT:TRIG 20"
   "CURR:TRIG 0.5"
   "INST:COUP P6V,P25V"
   "TRIG:SOUR IMM"
   "INIT"

Select the +6V output
Set triggered level to 5 V
Set triggered level to 3 A
Select the +25V output
Set triggered level to 20 V
Set triggered level to 0.5 A
Couple the +6V and +25V supply
Set trigger to immediate
Trigger the power supply to output 
the trigger values for
the +6V and the +25V supplies

Example (1)

N o t e    

 If you select the bus trigger source in the above program (see page 81 for the detailed 
information), you must send the *TRG or Group Execute Trigger (GET) command to 
start the trigger action after sending the INITiate command.

Output Setting and Operation Commands



INSTrument:COUPle[:TRIGger]?
This query returns the currently coupled output. Returns “ALL”, “NONE”, or  a list.  
If any output is not coupled, “NONE” is returned. If all of three outputs are coupled, 
“ALL” is returned. If a list of outputs is coupled, the list is returned.

Measurement Commands
MEASure:CURRent[:DC]? [{P6V|P25V|N25V}]
This command queries the current measured at the output terminals of the power 
supply. The physical outputs of measurement are specified by the output identifier. If 
any output identifier is not specified, the current of the currently selected output is 
returned.

MEASure[:VOLTage][:DC]? [{P6V|P25V|N25V}]
This command queries the voltage measured at the output terminals of the power 
supply. If any output identifier is not specified, the voltage of the currently selected 
output is returned.

78

Output Setting and Operation Commands

Output On/Off and Tracking Operation Commands
OUTPut[:STATe] {OFF|ON}
This command enables or disables all three outputs of the power supply. The state of 
the disabled outputs is a condition of less than 0.6 volts of opposite polarity with no 
load and less than 60 mA of opposite direction with a short circuit. At *RST, the 
output state is off.

OUTPut[:STATe]?
This command queries the output state of the power supply. The returned  value is 
“0” (OFF) or “1” (ON). 

OUTPut:TRACk[:STATe] {OFF|ON}
This command enables or disables the power supply to operate in the track mode. 
When the track mode is first enabled, the -25V supply will be set to  the same 
voltage level as the +25V supply. Once enabled, any change of the programmed 
voltage level in either +25V supply or -25V supply will be reflected in the other 
supply. The TRACk OFF command returns the power supply to the non-track 
mode. The ±25V supplies must not be coupled to enable “Track”. At *RST, the 
track mode is disabled.

OUTPut:TRACk[:STATe]?
This command queries the track mode state of the power supply. The returned value 
is “0” (OFF) or “1” (ON). 

Output Setting Commands
[SOURce:]CURRent[:LEVel][:IMMediate][:AMPLitude] 
{<current>|MINimum|MAXimum}
This command directly programs the immediate current level of the power supply. 
The immediate level is the current limit value of the output selected with the 
INSTrument command.
[SOURce:]CURRent[:LEVel][:IMMediate][:AMPLitude]?
[MINimum|MAXimum]
This query returns the presently programmed current limit level of the selected output. 
CURRent? MAXimum and CURRent? MINimum return the maximum and 
minimum programmable current levels of the selected output.



[SOURce:]CURRent[:LEVel]:TRIGgered[:AMPLitude] 
{<current>| MINimum|MAXimum} 
This command programs the pending triggered current level of the power supply. The 
pending triggered current level is a stored value that is transferred to the output 
terminals when a trigger occurs. A pending triggered level is not affected by 
subsequent CURRent commands.
[SOURce:]CURRent[:LEVel]:TRIGgered[:AMPLitude]?
[MINimum|MAXimum]
This query returns the presently programmed triggered current level. If no triggered 
level is programmed, the CURRent level is returned. CURRent :TRIGgered? 
MAXimum and CURRent:TRIGgered? MINimum return the maximum and 
minimum programmable triggered current levels.

VOLTage[:LEVel][:IMMediate][:AMPLitude] 
{<voltage>| MINimum|MAXimum}
This command directly programs the immediate voltage level of the power supply. 
The immediate level is the voltage limit value of the selected output with the 
INSTrument command.
[SOURce:]VOLTage[:LEVel][:IMMediate][:AMPLitude]?
[MINimum|MAXimum]
This query returns the presently programmed voltage limit level of the selected output. 
VOLTage? MAXimum and VOLTage? MINimum return the maximum and 
minimum programmable voltage levels of the selected output.

[SOURce:]VOLTage[:LEVel]:TRIGgered[:AMPLitude]
{<voltage>| MINimum|MAXimum}
This command programs the pending triggered voltage level of the power supply. The 
pending triggered voltage level is a stored value that is transferred to the output 
terminals when a trigger occurs. A pending triggered level is not affected by 
subsequent VOLTage commands.
[SOURce:]VOLTage[:LEVel]:TRIGgered[:AMPLitude]?
[MINimum|MAXimum]
This query returns the presently programmed triggered voltage level. If no triggered 
level is programmed, the VOLTage level is returned. VOLTage:TRIGgered? 
MAXimum and VOLTage:TRIGgered? MINimum return the maximum and 
minimum programmable triggered voltage levels.

Triggering Commands

Triggering Commands

The power supply's triggering system allows a change in voltage and current when 
receiving a trigger, to select a trigger source, and to insert a trigger. Triggering the 
power supply is a multi-step process.
• First, you must select an output with the INSTrument:SELect command and 

then configure the power supply for the triggered output level by using 
CURRent:TRIGgered and VOLTage:TRIGgered commands.

• Then, you must specify the source from which the power supply will accept the 
trigger. The power supply will accept a bus (software) trigger or an immediate 
trigger from the remote interface.

• Then, you can set the time delay between the detection of the trigger on the 

specified trigger source and the start of any corresponding output change. Notice 
that the time delay is valid for only the bus trigger source.

• Finally, you must provide an INITiate[:IMMediate]command. If the 
IMMediate source is selected, the selected output is set to the triggered level 
immediately. But if the trigger source is the bus, the power supply is set to the 
triggered level after receiving the Group Execute Trigger (GET) or *TRG 
command.

Trigger Source Choices
You must specify the source from which the power supply will accept a trigger. The 
trigger is stored in volatile memory; the source is set to bus when the power supply 
has been off or after a remote interface reset.

Bus (Software) Triggering
• To select the bus trigger source, send the following command.
  TRIGger:SOURce BUS 
• To trigger the power supply from the remote interface (GPIB or RS-232) after 
selecting the bus source, send the *TRG (trigger) command. When the *TRG is 
sent, the trigger action starts after the specified time delay if any delay is given.

4

81

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
Triggering Commands



• You can also trigger the power supply from the GPIB interface by sending the 

IEEE-488 Group Execute Trigger (GET) message. The following statement shows 
how to send a GET from a Keysight Technologies controller.

  TRIGGER 705 (group execute trigger)
• To ensure synchronization when the bus source is selected, send the *WAI (wait) 
command. When the *WAI command is executed, the power supply waits for all 
pending operations to complete before executing any additional commands. For 
example, the following command string guarantees that the first trigger is accepted 
and is executed before the second trigger is recognized.

  TRIG:SOUR BUS;*TRG;*WAI;*TRG;*WAI
• You can use the *OPC? (operation complete query) command or the  *OPC  
(operation complete) command to signal when the operation is complete. The 
*OPC? command returns “1” to the output buffer when the operation is complete. 
The *OPC command sets the “OPC” bit (bit 0) in the Standard Event register when 
the operation is complete.

Immediate Triggering
• To select the immediate trigger source, send the following command.
  TRIGger:SOURce IMM
• When the IMMediate is selected as a trigger source, an INITiate  command 

immediately transfers the VOLTage:TRIGgered[:AMPLitude] and 
CURRent:TRIGgered[:AMPLitude]values to 
VOLTage[:LEVel][:IMMediate][:AMPLitude] and CURRent 
[:LEVel][:IMMediate][:AMPLitude]values. Any delay is ignored.

Triggering Commands

Triggering Commands
INITiate[:IMMediate]
This command causes the trigger system to initiate. This command completes one full 
trigger cycle when the trigger source is an immediate and  initiates the trigger 
subsystem when the trigger source is bus.

TRIGger[:SEQuence]:DELay{<seconds>| MINimum|MAXimum}
This command sets the time delay between the detection of an event on the specified 
trigger source and the start of any corresponding trigger action on the power supply 
output. Select from 0 to 3600 seconds. MIN = 0 seconds. MAX = 3600 seconds. At 
*RST , this value is set to 0 seconds.
TRIGger[:SEQuence]:DELay?
This command queries the trigger delay.

TRIGger[:SEQuence]:SOURce {BUS|IMMediate}
This command selects the source from which the power supply will accept a trigger. 
The power supply will accept a bus (software) trigger or an internal immediate 
trigger. At *RST, the bus trigger source is selected.
TRIGger[:SEQuence]:SOURce?
This command queries the present trigger source. Returns “BUS” or “IMM”.

4

*TRG
This command generates a trigger to the trigger subsystem that has selected a bus 
(software) trigger as its source (TRIGger:SOURce BUS). The command has the 
same effect as the Group Execute Trigger (GET) command. For RS-232 operation, 
make sure the power supply is in the remote interface mode by sending the 
SYSTem:REMote command first.

System-Related Commands

SYSTem:ERRor?
This command queries the power supply's error queue. When the front-panel ERROR 
annunciator turns on, one or more command syntax or hardware errors have been 
detected. Up to 20 errors can be stored in the error queue. See “Error Messages” in 
chapter 5.
• Errors are retrieved in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The first error returned is the 

first error that was stored. When you have read all errors from the queue, the 
ERROR annunciator turns off. The power supply beeps once each time an error is 
generated.
If more than 20 errors have occurred, the last error stored in the queue (the most 
recent error) is replaced with -350, “Queue overflow”. No additional errors are 
stored until you remove errors from the queue. If no errors have occurred when 
you read the error queue, the power supply responds with +0, “No error”.

•

• The error queue is cleared when power has been off or after a *CLS (clear status) 
command has been executed. The *RST (reset) command does not clear the 
error queue.

SYSTem:VERSion?
This command queries the power supply to determine the present SCPI  version. The 
returned value is of a string in the form YYYY.V where the “Y’s” represent the year 
of the version, and the “V” represents a version number for that year (for example, 
1995.0). 

*IDN?
This query command reads the power supply's identification string. The power supply 
returns four fields separated by commas. The first field is the manufacturer's name, 
the second field is the model number, the third field is not used (always “0”), and the 
fourth field is a revision code which contains three numbers. The first number is the 
firmware revision number for the main power supply processor; the second is for the 
input/output processor; and the third is for the front-panel processor.
The command returns a string with the following format (be sure to dimension a string 
variable with at least 40 characters): 

      HEWLETT-PACKARD,E3631A,0,X.X-X.X-X.X

*SAV { 1|2|3 }
This command stores the present state of the power supply to the specified location 
in non-volatile memory. Three memory locations (numbered 1, 2 and 3) are available 
to store operating states of the power supply. The state storage feature “remembers” 
the states or values of INST[:SEL], VOLT[:IMM], CURR[:IMM], 
OUTP[:STAT], OUTP:TRAC, TRIG:SOUR, and TRIG:DEL. To recall a stored 
state, you must use the same memory location used previously to store the state.

*RCL {1|2|3 }
This command recalls a previously stored state. To recall a stored state, you must use 
the same memory location used previously to store the state. You recall *RST states 
or values of the power supply from a memory location that was not previously 
specified as a storage location.

Calibration Commands

Calibration Commands

See “Calibration Overview”, for more information starting on page 60 in chapter 3 
for an overview of the calibration features of the power supply. For more detailed 
discussion of the calibration procedures, see the Service Guide.

CALibration:COUNt?
This command queries the power supply to determine the number of times it has been 
calibrated. Your power supply was calibrated before it left the factory. When you 
receive your power supply, read the count to determine its initial value. Since the value 
increments by one for each calibration point, a complete calibration for three outputs 
will increase the value by six counts.

CALibration:CURRent[:DATA] <numeric value>
This command can only be used after calibration is unsecured. It enters a current 
value of a selected output that you obtained by reading an external meter. You must 
first select a calibration level (CAL:CURR:LEV) for the value being entered. Two 
successive values (one for each end of the calibration range) must be selected and 
entered. The power supply then computes new calibration constants. These 
constants are then stored in non-volatile memory.

4

CALibration:CURRent:LEVel {MINimum|MAXimum}
Before using this command, you must select the output which is to be calibrated by 
using INSTrument command. This command can only be used after calibration is 
unsecured. It sets the power supply to a calibration point that is entered with 
CALibration:CURRent[:DATA] command. During calibration, two points 
must be entered and the low-end point (MIN) must be selected and entered first.

CALibration:SECure:CODE <new code>
This command enters a new security code. To change the security code, first unsecure 
the power supply using the old security code. Then, enter the new code. The 
calibration code may contain up to 12 characters over the remote interface but the first 
character must always be a letter. 

87

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
Calibration Commands



CALibration:SECure:STATe {OFF|ON>}, <code>
This command unsecures or secures the power supply for calibration. The calibration 
code may contain up to 12 characters over the remote interface. 

CALibration:SECure:STATe?
This command queries the secured state for calibration of the power supply. The 
returned parameter is “0” (OFF) or “1” (ON).

CALibration:STRing <quoted string>
This command records calibration information about your power supply.  
For example, you can store such information as the last calibration date, the next 
calibration due date, or the power supply’s serial number. The calibration message 
may contain up to 40 characters. The power supply should be unsecured before 
sending a calibration message.

CALibration:STRing?
This command queries the calibration message and returns a quoted string.

CALibration:VOLTage[:DATA] <numeric value>
This command can only be used after calibration is unsecured. It enters a voltage value 
of a selected output that you obtained by reading an external meter. You must first 
select a calibration level (CAL:VOLT:LEV) for the value being entered. Two 
successive values (one for each end of the calibration range) must be selected and 
entered. The power supply then computes new voltage calibration constants. These 
constants are then stored in non-volatile memory.

CALibration:VOLTage:LEVel {MINimum|MAXimum}
Before using this command, you must select the output which is to be calibrated by 
using INSTrument command. This command can only be used after calibration is 
unsecured. It sets the power supply to a calibration point that is entered with 
CALibration:VOLTage[:DATA] command. During calibration, two points 
must be entered and the low-end point (MIN) must be selected.

RS-232 Interface Commands

RS-232 Interface Commands

Use the front-panel “I/O configuration” key to select the baud rate, parity, 
and the number of data bits (See “Remote Interface Configuration”, for more 
information starting on page 50 in chapter 3).

SYSTem:LOCal
This command places the power supply in the local mode during RS-232  operation. 
All keys on the front panel are fully functional.

SYSTem:REMote
This command places the power supply in the remote mode for RS-232 operation. 
All keys on the front panel, except the “Local” key, are disabled.

It is very important that you send the SYSTem:REMote command to place the 
power supply in the remote mode. Sending or receiving data over the RS-232 
interface when not configured for remote operation can cause unpredictable 
results.

4

SYSTem:RWLock
This command places the power supply in the remote mode for RS-232 operation. 
This command is the same as the SYSTem:REMote command except that all keys 
on the front panel are disabled, including the “Local” key.

Ctrl-C
This command clears the operation in progress over the RS-232 interface  and discard 
any pending output data. This is equivalent to the IEEE-488 device clear action over 
the GPIB interface.

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
The SCPI Status Registers



The SCPI Status Registers

All SCPI instruments implement status registers in the same way. The status system 
records various instrument conditions in three register groups: the Status Byte register, 
the Standard Event register, and the Questionable Status register group. The status 
byte register records high-level summary information reported in the other register 
groups. The diagrams on the subsequent pages illustrate the SCPI status system used 
by the power supply.
An example program is included in chapter 6, “Application Programs,” which shows 
the use of the status registers. You may find it useful to refer to the program after 
reading the following section in this chapter.

What is an Event Register?
An event register is a read-only register that reports defined conditions within the 
power supply. Bits in an event register are latched. Once an event bit is set, subsequent 
state changes are ignored. Bits in an event register are automatically cleared by a query 
of that register (such as *ESR? or STAT:QUES:EVEN?) or by sending the *CLS 
(clear status) command. A reset (*RST) or device clear will not clear bits in event 
registers. Querying an event register returns a decimal value which corresponds to the 
binary-weighted sum of all bits set in the register.

What is an Enable Register?
An enable register defines which bits in the corresponding event register are logically 
ORed together to form a single summary bit. Enable registers are both readable and 
writable. Querying an enable register will not clear it. The *CLS (clear status) 
command does not clear enable registers but it does clear the bits in the event registers. 
To enable bits in an enable register, you must write a decimal value which corresponds 
to the binary-weighted sum of the bits you wish to enable in the register.

What is a Multiple Logical Output?
The three-logical outputs of the power supply include an INSTrument summary status 
register and an individual instrument ISUMmary register for each logical output. The 
ISUMmary registers report to the INSTrument register, which in turn reports to bit 
13 of the Questionable status register. This is shown pictorially on the next page. 
Using such a status register configuration allows a status event to be cross-referenced 
by output and type of event. The INSTrument register indicates which output(s) have 
generated an event. The ISUMmary register is a pseudo-questionable status register 
for a particular logical output.

The SCPI Status Registers

The Questionable Status Register
The Questionable Status register provides information about unexpected operation of 
the power supply. Bit 4 reports a fault with the fan, and bit 13 summarizes questionable 
outputs for any of the three supplies. For example if one of the three supplies is in 
constant voltage mode and due to an overload loses regulation, bit 13 is set (latched). 
Send the command STAT:QUES? to read the register. To make use of bit 13 you must 
first enable registers you wish to summarize with bit 13. Send 
STAT:QUES:INST:ENAB 14 to enable the Questionable Instrument register. Then 
send STAT:QUES:INST:ISUM<n>:ENAB 3 for each supply to enable the 
Questionable Instrument Summary register, where n is 1, 2, or 3.

The Questionable Instrument Status Register
The Questionable Instrument register provides information about unexpected 
operations for each of the three supplies. For example if the +6V supply is in the 
constant voltage mode and loses regulation, then bit 1 set indicating a possible 
overload in the +6V supply. The +25V supply is reported as bit 2, and the -25V supply 
as bit 3. Send the command STAT QUES:INST? to read the register. The 
STAT:QUES:INST:ISUM<n> registers must be enabled to make use of the 
Questionable Instrument register. Send STAT:QUES:INST:ISUM<n>:ENAB 3 
to enable output n.

The Questionable Instrument Summary Register
There are three Questionable Instrument Summary registers, one for each supply 
output. These registers provide information about voltage and current regulation. Bit 
0 is set when the voltage becomes unregulated, and bit 1 is set if the current becomes 
unregulated. For example if a supply which is operating as a voltage source (constant 
voltage mode) momentarily goes to constant current mode, bit 0 is set to indicate that 
the voltage output is not regulated. To read the register for each supply, send 
STAT:QUES:INST:ISUM<n>?, where n is 1, 2, or 3.

93

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
The SCPI Status Registers



To determine the operating mode (CV or CC) for the power supply send 
STAT:QUES:INST:ISUM<n>:COND?, where n is 1, 2, or 3 depending on  the 
output. Bit 1 true indicates the output is in constant voltage mode, bit 0 true indicates 
constant current mode, both bits true indicates neither the voltage nor the current is 
regulated, and both bits false indicates the outputs of the power supply are off.

The Questionable Status Event register is cleared when:
• You execute the *CLS (clear status) command.
• You query the event register using STATus:QUEStionable[:EVENt]?  

(Status Questionable Event register) command.

For example, 16 is returned when you have queried the status of the questionable 
event register, the FAN condition is questionable.

The Questionable Status Enable register is cleared when:
• You execute STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle 0 command.
For example, you must send the STAT:QUES:ENAB 16 to enable the FAN bit. 

94



Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
The SCPI Status Registers

The Standard Event Register
The Standard Event register reports the following types of instrument events: power-
on detected, command syntax errors, command execution errors, self-test or 
calibration errors, query errors, or when an *OPC command is executed. Any or all 
of these conditions can be reported in the Standard Event Summary bit (ESB, bit 5) 
of Status Byte register through the enable register. To set the enable register mask, 
you write a decimal value to the register using the *ESE (Event Status Enable) 
command.

An error condition (Standard Event register bits 2, 3, 4, or 5) will always record 
one or more errors in the power supply's error queue. Read the error queue using 
the SYSTem:ERRor? command.

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
The SCPI Status Registers



The Standard Event register is cleared when:
• You execute the *CLS (clear status) command.
• You query the event register using the *ESR? (Event Status register) command.
For example, 28 (4 + 8 + 16) is returned when you have queried the status of the 
Standard Event register, QYE, DDE, and EXE conditions have occurred.

The Standard Event Enable register is cleared when:
• You execute the *ESE 0 command.
• You turn on the power and have previously configured the power supply using the 

*PSC 1 command.

• The enable register will not be cleared at power-on if you have previously 

configured the power supply using the *PSC 0 command.

For example, you must send the *ESE 24 (8 + 16) to enable DDE and EXE 
bits. 

The Status Byte Register
The Status Byte summary register reports conditions from the other status registers. 
Query data that is waiting in the power supply's output buffer is immediately reported 
through the “Message Available” bit (bit 4) of Status Byte register. Bits in the summary 
register are not latched. Clearing an event register will clear the corresponding bits in 
the Status Byte summary register. Reading all messages in the output buffer, including 
any pending queries, will clear the message available bit.

The SCPI Status Registers

The Status Byte Summary register is cleared when:
• You execute the *CLS (clear status) command.
• Querying the Standard Event register (*ESR? command) will clear only bit 5 in 

the Status Byte summary register.

For example, 24 (8 + 16) is returned when you have queried the status of the Status 
Byte register, QUES and MAV conditions have occurred.

The Status Byte Enable register (Request Service) is cleared when:
• You execute the *SRE 0 command.
• You turn on the power and have previously configured the power supply using the 

*PSC 1 command.

• The enable register will not be cleared at power-on if you have previously 

configured the power supply using *PSC 0.

For example, you must send the *SRE 96 (32 + 64) to enable ESB and RQS bits. 

Using Service Request (SRQ) and Serial POLL
You must configure your bus controller to respond to the IEEE-488 service request 
(SRQ) interrupt to use this capability. Use the Status Byte enable register (*SRE 
command) to select which summary bits will set the low-level IEEE-488 service 
request signal. When bit 6 (request service) is set in the Status Byte, an IEEE-488 
service request interrupt message is automatically sent to the bus controller. The bus 
controller may then poll the instruments on the bus to identify which one requested 
service (the instrument with bit 6 set in its Status Byte). 

The request service bit is cleared only by reading the Status Byte using an IEEE-488 
serial poll or by reading the event register whose summary bit is causing the service 
request.
To read the Status Byte summary register, send the IEEE-488 serial poll message. 
Querying the summary register will return a decimal value which corresponds to the 
binary-weighted sum of the bits set in the register. Serial poll will automatically clear 
the “request service” bit in the Status Byte summary register. No other bits are affected. 
Performing a serial poll will not affect instrument throughput.

97

C a u t i o n    

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
The SCPI Status Registers



The IEEE-488 standard does not ensure synchronization between your bus controller 
program and the instrument. Use the *OPC? command to guarantee that commands 
previously sent to the instrument have completed. Executing a serial poll before a 
*RST,*CLS, or other commands have completed can cause previous conditions to 
be reported.

Using *STB? to Read the Status Byte
The *STB? (Status Byte query) command is similar to a serial poll but it is processed 
like any other instrument command. The *STB? command  returns the same result 
as a serial poll but the “request service” bit (bit 6) is not cleared. 
The*STB? command is not handled automatically by the IEEE-488 bus interface 
hardware and will be executed only after previous commands have completed. Polling 
is not possible using the *STB? command. Executing the *STB? command does 
not clear the Status Byte summary register.

Using the Message Available Bit (MAV)
You can use the Status Byte “message available” bit (bit 4) to determine when data is 
available to read into your bus controller. The power supply subsequently clears bit 
4 only after all messages have been read from the output buffer.

To Interrupt Your Bus Controller Using SRQ

1 Send a device clear message to clear the power supply's output buffer (e.g.,  CLEAR 

705).

2 Clear the event registers with the *CLS (clear status) command.
3 Set up the enable register masks. Execute the *ESE command to set up the Standard 

Event register and the *SRE command for the Status Byte.

4 Send the *OPC? (operation complete query) command and enter the result to ensure 

synchronization.

5 Enable your bus controller's IEEE-488 SRQ interrupt.

98



Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
The SCPI Status Registers

To Determine When a Command Sequence is Completed

1 Send a device clear message to clear the power supply's output buffer 

(e.g., CLEAR 705).

2 Clear the event registers with the *CLS (clear status) command.
3 Enable the “operation complete” bit (bit 0) in the Standard Event register by executing 

the *ESE 1 command.

4 Send the *OPC? (operation complete query) command and enter the result to ensure 

synchronization.

5 Execute your command string to program the desired configuration, and then execute 

the *OPC (operation complete) command as the last command. When the command 
sequence is completed, the “operation complete” bit (bit 0) is set in the Standard 
Event register. 

6 Use a serial poll to check to see when bit 5 (standard event) is set in the Status Byte 
summary register. You could also configure the power supply for an SRQ interrupt 
by sending *SRE 32 (Status Byte enable register, bit 5).

4

Using *OPC to Signal When Data is in the Output Buffer
Generally, it is best to use the “operation complete” bit (bit 0) in the Standard Event 
register to signal when a command sequence is completed. This bit is set in the register 
after an *OPC command has been executed. If you send *OPC after a command which 
loads a message in the power supply's output buffer (query data), you can use the 
“operation complete” bit to determine when the message is available. However, if too 
many messages are generated before the *OPC command executes (sequentially), the 
output buffer will fill and the power supply will stop processing commands.

Status Reporting Commands



Status Reporting Commands

See diagram “SCPI Status System”, on page 92 in this chapter for detailed 
information of the status register structure of the power supply.

SYSTem:ERRor?
This query command reads one error from the error queue. When the front-panel 
ERROR annunciator turns on, one or more command syntax or hardware errors have 
been detected. A record of up to 20 errors can be stored in the power supply’s error 
queue. See “Error Messages” in chapter 5
• Errors are retrieved in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The first error returned is the 

first error that was stored. When you have read all errors from the queue, the 
ERROR annunciator turns off. The power supply beeps once each time an error is 
generated.
If more than 20 errors have occurred, the last error stored in the queue (the most 
recent error) is replaced with -350, “Queue overflow”. No additional errors are 
stored until you remove errors from the queue. If no errors have occurred when 
you read the error queue, the power supply responds with +0, “No error”.

•

• The error queue is cleared when power has been off or after a *CLS (clear status) 
command has been executed. The *RST (reset) command does not clear the error 
queue.

STATus:QUEStionable[:EVENt]?
This command queries the Questionable Status event register. The power supply 
returns a decimal value which corresponds to the binary-weighted sum of all bits in 
the register.

STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle <enable value>  
This command enables bits in the Questionable Status enable register. The selected 
bits are then reported to the Status Byte. 

STATus:QUEStionable:ENABle?
This command queries the Questionable Status enable register. The power supply 
returns a binary-weighted decimal representing the bits set in the enable register.

Status Reporting Commands

STATus:QUEStionable:INSTrument[:EVENt]?
This command queries the Questionable Instrument event register. The power supply 
returns a decimal value which corresponds to the binary-weighted sum of all bits in 
the register and clears the register.

STATus:QUEStionable:INSTrument:ENABle <enable value>
This command sets the value of the Questionable Instrument enable register. This 
register is a mask for enabling specific bits from the Questionable Instrument event 
register to set the Instrument Summary bit (ISUM, bit 13) of the Questionable Status 
register. The “ISUM” bit of the Questionable Status register is the logical OR of all 
the Questionable Instrument event register bits that are enabled by the Questionable 
Instrument enable register.

STATus:QUEStionable:INSTrument:ENABle?
This query returns the value of the Questionable Instrument enable register.

STATus:QUEStionable:INSTrument:ISUMmary<n>[:EVENt]?
This query returns the value of the Questionable Instrument Isummary event 
register for a specific output of the three-output power supply. The particular output 
must be specified by a numeric value. n is 1, 2, or 3. See Table 4-1 on page 74 for 
the output number. The event register is a read-only register which holds (latches) all 
events. Reading the Questionable Instrument Isummary event register clears it.

4

STATus:QUEStionable:INSTrument:ISUMmary<n>:CONDition?
This query returns the CV or CC condition of the specified instrument. If “2” is 
returned, the queried instrument is in the CV operating mode. If “1” is returned, the 
queried instrument is in the CC operating mode. If  “0” is returned, the outputs of the 
instrument are off or unregulated. If ‘3” is returned, the instrument is in the hardware 
failure. n is 1, 2, or 3.

STATus:QUEStionable:INSTrument:ISUMmary<n>:ENABle <enable value>
This command sets the value of the Questionable Instrument Isummary enable register 
for a specific output of the three-output power supply. The particular output must be 
specified by a numeric value. n is 1, 2, or 3. See Table 4-1 on page 74 for the output 
number. This register is a mask for enabling specific bits from the Questionable 
Instrument Isummary event register to set the Instrument Summary bit (bit 1, 2, and 
3) of the Questionable Instrument register. These bits 1, 2, and bit 3 are the logical

Status Reporting Commands



STATus:QUEStionable:INSTrument:ISUMmary<n>:ENABle?
This query returns the value of the Questionable Instrument Isummary enable register. 
n is 1, 2, or 3.

*CLS
This command clears all event registers and Status Byte register.

*ESE<enable value>
This command enables bits in the Standard Event enable register. The selected bits 
are then reported to the Status Byte. 

*ESE?
This command queries the Standard Event enable register. The power supply returns 
a decimal value which corresponds to the binary-weighted sum of all bits in the 
register.

*ESR?
This command queries the Standard event register. The power supply returns a 
decimal value which corresponds to the binary-weighted sum of all bits in the register.

*OPC
This command sets the “Operation Complete” bit (bit 0) of the Standard Event register 
after the command is executed.

*OPC?
This command returns “1” to the output buffer after the command is executed.

*PSC { 0|1 }
(Power-on status clear.) This command clears the Status Byte and the Standard Event 
register enable masks when power is turned on (*PSC 1). When *PSC 0 is in effect, 
the Status Byte and Standard Event register enable masks are not cleared when power 
is turned on.

*PSC?
This command queries the power-on status clear setting. The returned parameter is 
“0” (*PSC 0) or “1” (*PSC 1).

102

Status Reporting Commands

*SRE <enable value>
This command enables bits in the Status Byte enable register.

*SRE?
This command queries the Status Byte Enable register. The power supply returns a 
decimal value which corresponds to the binary-weighted sum of all bits set in the 
register.

*STB?
This command queries the Status Byte summary register. The *STB?  command is 
similar to a serial poll but it is processed like any other instrument command. The 
*STB? command returns the same result as a serial poll but the “Request Service” 
bit (bit 6) is not cleared if a serial poll has occurred.

*WAI
This command instructs the power supply to wait for all pending operations to 
complete before executing any additional commands over the interface. Used only 
in the triggered mode.

An Introduction to the SCPI Language

An Introduction to the SCPI Language

SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) is an ASCII-based 
instrument command language designed for test and measurement instruments. Refer 
to “Simplified Programming Overview”, starting on page 70 for an introduction to 
the basic techniques used to program the power supply over the remote interface.
SCPI commands are based on a hierarchical structure, also known as a tree system. 
In this system, associated commands are grouped together under a common node or 
root, thus forming subsystems. A portion of the SOURce subsystem is shown below 
to illustrate the tree system.

[SOURce:]

CURRent {<current>|MIN|MAX}
CURRent? [MIN|MAX]
CURRent:
  TRIGgered {<current>|MIN|MAX}
  TRIGgered?{MIN|MAX}
VOLTage {<voltage>|MIN|MAX}
VOLTage? [MIN|MAX]
VOLTage:
  TRIGgered {<voltage>|MIN|MAX}
  TRIGgered? {MIN|MAX}

SOURce is the root keyword of the command, CURRent and VOLTage are second-
level keywords, and TRIGgered is third-level keywords. A colon (:) separates a 
command keyword from a lower-level keyword.

104



Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
An Introduction to the SCPI Language

Command Format Used in This Manual
The format used to show commands in this manual is shown below: 
  CURRent {<current>|MINimum|MAXimum}

The command syntax shows most commands (and some parameters) as a mixture of 
upper- and lower-case letters. The upper-case letters indicate the abbreviated spelling 
for the command. For shorter program lines, send the abbreviated form. For better 
program readability, send the long form. 
For example, in the above syntax statement, CURR and CURRENT are both acceptable 
forms. You can use upper- or lower-case letters. Therefore, CURRENT, curr, and 
Curr are all acceptable. Other forms, such as CUR and  CURREN, will generate an 
error.

Braces( { }) enclose the parameter choices for a given command string. The braces 
are not sent with the command string. 
A vertical bar ( | ) separates multiple parameter choices for a given 
command string.
Triangle brackets ( < >) indicate that you must specify a value for the enclosed 
parameter. For example, the above syntax statement shows the current parameter 
enclosed in triangle brackets. The brackets are not sent with the command string. You 
must specify a value for the parameter (such as "CURR 0.1"). 
Some parameters are enclosed in square brackets ( [ ] ). The brackets indicate that the 
parameter is optional and can be omitted. The brackets are not sent with the command 
string. If you do not specify a value for an optional parameter, the power supply 
chooses a default value.  
A colon ( : ) separates a command keyword from a lower-level keyword. You must 
insert a blank space to separate a parameter from a command keyword. If a command 
requires more than one parameter, you must separate adjacent parameters using a 
comma as shown below:
  "SOURce:CURRent:TRIGgered"
  "APPL P6V,3.5,1.5"

4

105

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
An Introduction to the SCPI Language



Command Separators 
A colon ( : ) is used to separate a command keyword from a lower-level keyword as 
shown below:
  "SOURce:CURRent:TRIGgered"

A semicolon ( ; ) is used to separate two commands within the same subsystem, and 
can also minimize typing. For example, sending the following command string: 
  "SOUR:VOLT MIN;CURR MAX"
... is the same as sending the following two commands: 
  "SOUR:VOLT MIN"
  "SOUR:CURR MAX"

Use a colon and a semicolon to link commands from different subsystems. For 
example, in the following command string, an error is generated if you do not use the 
colon and semicolon:
  "INST P6V;:SOUR:CURR MIN"

Using the MIN and MAX parameters
You can substitute MINimum or MAXimum in place of a parameter for many 
commands. For example, consider the following command: 

CURRent {<current>|MIN|MAX}

Instead of selecting a specific current, you can substitute MINimum to set the current 
to its minimum value or MAXimum to set the current to its maximum value.

106



Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
An Introduction to the SCPI Language

Querying Parameter Settings
You can query the value of most parameters by adding a question mark (?) to the 
command. For example, the following command sets the output current to 5 amps:
  "CURR 5"
You can query the value by executing:
  "CURR?"
You can also query the minimum or maximum value allowed with the present function 
as follows:
  "CURR? MAX"
  "CURR? MIN"

C a u t i o n    

If you send two query commands without reading the response from the first, and 
then attempt to read the second response, you may receive some data from the first 
response followed by the complete second response. To avoid this, do not send a 
query command without reading the response. When you cannot avoid this 
situation, send a device clear before sending the second query command.

4

SCPI Command Terminators
A command string sent to the power supply must terminate with a <new line> 
character. The IEEE-488 EOI (end-or-identify) message is interpreted as a <new line> 
character and can be used to terminate a command string in place of a <new line> 
character. A <carriage return>  followed by a <new line> is also accepted. Command 
string termination will always reset the current SCPI command path to the root level. 

IEEE-488.2 Common Commands
The IEEE-488.2 standard defines a set of common commands that perform functions 
like reset, self-test, and status operations. Common commands always begin with an 
asterisk ( * ), are four to five characters in length, and may include one or more 
parameters. The command keyword is separated from the first parameter by a blank 
space. Use a semicolon ( ; ) to separate multiple commands as shown below:
  "*RST; *CLS; *ESE 32; *OPC?"

107

Chapter 4 Remote Interface Reference
An Introduction to the SCPI Language



SCPI Parameter Types
The SCPI language defines several different data formats to be used in program 
messages and response messages. 

Numeric Parameters  Commands that require numeric parameters will accept all 
commonly used decimal representations of numbers including  optional signs, 
decimal points, and scientific notation. Special values for numeric parameters like 
MINimum,MAXimum, and DEFault are also accepted. You can also send 
engineering unit suffixes (V, A or SEC) with numeric parameters. If only specific 
numeric values are accepted, the power supply will automatically round the input 
numeric parameters. The following command uses a numeric parameter:
   CURR {<current>|MINimum|MAXimum}

Discrete Parameters  Discrete parameters are used to program settings that have a 
limited number of values (like BUS, IMM). Query responses will always return the 
short form in all upper-case letters. The following command uses discrete parameters: 
   TRIG:SOUR {BUS|IMM}

Boolean Parameters  Boolean parameters represent a single binary condition that is 
either true or false. For a false condition, the power supply will accept “OFF” or “0”. 
For a true condition, the power supply will accept “ON” or “1”. When you query a 
boolean setting, the power supply will always return “0” or “1”. The following 
command uses a boolean parameter:
   DISP {OFF|ON}

String Parameters  String parameters can contain virtually any set of ASCII 
characters. A string must begin and end with matching quotes; either with a single 
quote or with a double quote. You can include the quote delimiter as part of the string 
by typing it twice without any characters in between. The following command uses 
a string parameter:
   DISPlay:TEXT <quoted string>

108

Halting an Output in Progress

Halting an Output in Progress

You can send a device clear at any time to stop an output in progress over the GPIB 
interface. The status registers, the error queue, and all configuration states are left 
unchanged when a device clear message is received. Device clear performs the 
following actions.
• The power supply's input and output buffers are cleared.
• The power supply is prepared to accept a new command string.
• The following statement shows how to send a device clear over the GPIB interface 

using Keysight BASIC.
   CLEAR 705 
• The following statement shows how to send a device clear over the GPIB 

IEEE-488 Device Clear

interface using the GPIB Command Library for C or QuickBASIC.
   IOCLEAR (705)

4

For RS-232 operation, sending the <Ctrl-C> character will perform the same 
operation as the IEEE-488 device clear message. The power supply's DTR (data 
terminal ready) handshake line is set true following a device clear message. See 
DTR/DSR Handshake Protocol, on page 58 for further  details.

N o t e    

All remote interface configurations can be entered only from the front panel.  See 
“RS-232 Interface Configuration” on page 56. to configure for GPIB or RS-232 
interface before operating the power supply remotely.

Error Messages

When the front-panel ERROR annunciator turns on, one or more command syntax or 
hardware errors have been detected. A record of up to 20 errors is stored in the power 
supply's error queue. The power supply beeps once each time an error is generated.
• Errors are retrieved in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The first error returned is the 
first error that was stored. When you have read all errors from the queue, the ERROR 
annunciator turns off. 
If more than 20 errors have occurred, the last error stored in the queue (the  most 
recent error) is replaced with -350, “Queue overflow”. No additional  errors are stored 
until you remove errors from the queue. If no errors have occurred when you read the 
error queue, the supply responds with + 0, “No error” over the remote interface or 
“NO ERRORS” from the front panel.

•

• The error queue is cleared when power has been off or after a *CLS (clear status) 
command has been executed. The *RST (reset) command does not  clear the error 
queue.

Self-test failed
The power supply's complete self-test failed from the remote interface (*TST? 
command). In addition to this error, more specific self-test errors are also reported. 
See also “Self-Test Errors”, starting on See “Self-Test Errors”, for more information 
starting on page 123 in chapter 5.

Queue overflow
The error queue is full because more than 20 errors have occurred. No additional errors 
are stored until you remove errors from the queue. The error queue is cleared when 
power has been off, or after a *CLS (clear status) command has been executed. 
Query INTERRUPTED
A command was received which sends data to the output buffer, but the output buffer 
contained data from a previous command (the previous data is not overwritten). The 
output buffer is cleared when power has been off, or after a *RST (reset) command 
has been executed. 

Query UNTERMINATED
The power supply was addressed to talk (i.e., to send data over the interface) but a 
command has not been received which sends data to the output buffer. For example, 
you may have executed an APPLy command (which does not generate data) and then 
attempted an ENTER statement to read data from the remote interface.
Query DEADLOCKED
A command was received which generates too much data to fit in the output buffer 
and the input buffer is also full. Command execution continues but all data is lost.

12 alphanumeric characters.  The first character must be a letter. 

Secure code too long
A security code was received which contained more than 12 characters.

Cal output disabled
Calibration is aborted by sending OUTP OFF command during calibrating a output.
Cal sequence interrupted
Calibration sequence is interrupted by changing the instrument selection during 
calibrating an output.

Bad DAC cal data
The specified DAC calibration constants (CAL:VOLT or CAL:CURR) are out of 
range. Note that the new calibration constants are not stored in the 
non-volatile memory.

Bad readback cal data
The specified readback calibration constants (CAL:VOLT or CAL:CURR) are out of

Application Programs

This chapter contains several remote interface application programs to help you 
develop programs for your own application. Chapter 4, “Remote Interface 
Reference,” starting on page 65, lists the syntax for the SCPI (Standard Commands 
for Programmable Instruments) commands available to program the power supply. 

Keysight BASIC Programs
All of the Keysight BASIC example programs in this chapter were developed and 
tested on an HP 9000 Series 300 controller. Each device on the GPIB (IEEE-488) 
interface must have a unique address. You can set the power supply's address to any 
value between 0 and 30. The current address is displayed momentarily on the front 
panel when you turn on the power supply. 
The GPIB (IEEE-488) address is set to “05” when the power supply is shipped from 
the factory. The example programs in this chapter assume an GPIB address of 05. 
When sending a command over the remote interface, you append this address to the 
GPIB interface's select code (normally “7”). For example, if the select code is “7” and 
the device address is “05”, the combination is “705”.

C and QuickBASIC Language Programs
All of the C and QuickBASIC Language example programs in this chapter are written 
for the Keysight 82335 GPIB Interface Card using the GPIB Command Library for 
C. Unless otherwise noted, the library functions used in the example programs are 
compatible with the ANSI C standard. All of the C Language programs were compiled 
and tested using the following compilers:
• Microsoft QuickC Version 2.0

• Borland Turbo C ++ Version 1.0
To compile the program to make an executable file, refer to the language manuals. To 
link the object file you must previously specify TCLHPIB.LIB as a required library 
file from the menu.

Overview of Keysight E3631A Operation 

Series regulated power supplies were introduced many years ago and are still used 
extensively today. The basic design technique, which has not changed over the years, 
consists of placing a control element in series with the rectifier and load device.  Figure 
7-1 shows a simplified schematic of a series regulated supply with the series element 
depicted as a variable resistor. Feedback control circuits continuously monitor the 
output and adjust the series resistance to maintain a constant output voltage. Because 
the variable resistance of Figure 7-1 is actually one or more power transistor operating 
in the linear (class A) mode, supplies with this type of regulator are often called linear 
power supplies. Linear power supplies have many advantages and usually provide the 
simplest most effective means of satisfying high performance and low power 
requirements.

Figure 7-1. Diagram of Simple Series Power Supply with Tap Selection

To keep the voltage across the series resistance low, some supplies use preregulation 
before the rectifier bridge. Figure 7-1 shows a controlled transformer tap as used in 
the Keysight E3631A. This is one of several techniques using semiconductors for 
preregulation to reduce the power dissipated across the series element.

Overview of Keysight E3631A Operation



In terms of performance, linear regulated supplies have a very precise regulating 
properties and respond quickly to variations of the line and load.  Hence, their line 
and load regulation and transient recovery time are superior to supplies using other 
regulation techniques.  These supplies also exhibit low ripple and noise, are tolerant 
of ambient temperature changes, and with their circuit simplicity, have a high 
reliability.
The Keysight E3631A contains three linear regulated power supplies.  Each is 
controlled by a control circuit that provides voltages to program the outputs.  Each 
supply sends back to the control circuit voltages representing outputs at the terminals.   
The control circuits receive information from the front panel and send information to 
the display.  Similarly the control circuits “talk” to the remote interface for input and 
output with the GPIB and RS-232 interfaces.

Figure 7-2. Block Diagram of the Three Supplies Showing the Isolation

The control circuit and display circuit share the same common ground as the  ±25V 
supplies. The remote interface is at earth ground and isolated from the control circuit 
and the ±25V supplies. The +6V supply is also isolated from the remote interface and 
the ±25V supplies.

Output Characteristics

Output Characteristics

An ideal constant-voltage power supply would have a zero output impedance
at all frequencies. Thus, as shown in Figure 7-3, the voltage would remain perfectly 
constant in spite of any changes in output current demanded by the load.

Figure 7-3. Ideal Constant Voltage           Figure 7-4. Ideal Constant Current
                   Power Supply                                             Power Supply

The ideal constant-current power supply exhibits an infinite output impedance at all 
frequencies. Thus as Figure 7-4 indicates, the ideal constant-current power supply 
would accommodate a load resistance change by altering its output voltage by just 
the amount necessary to maintain its output current at a constant value.
Each of the three Keysight E3631A power supply outputs can operate in either 
constant-voltage (CV) mode or constant-current (CC) mode. Under certain fault 
conditions, the power supply cannot operate in either CV or CC mode and becomes 
unregulated.

Output Characteristics



Figure 7-5 shows the operating modes of the three outputs of the Keysight E3631A 
power supply. The operating point of one supply will be either above or below the 
line RL = RC. This line represents a load where the output voltage and the output 
current are equal to the voltage and current setting. When the load RL is greater than 
RC, the output voltage will dominate since the current will be less then the current 
setting. The power supply is said to be in constant-voltage mode. The load at point 1 
has a relatively high resistance value (compared to RC), the output voltage is at the 
voltage setting, and the output current is less than the current setting. In this case the 
power supply is in the constant-voltage mode and the current setting acts as a current 
limit.

Figure 7-5. Output Characteristics

When the load RL is less than RC, the output current will dominate since the voltage 
will be less than the set voltage. The power supply is said to be in constant-current 
mode. The load at point 2 has a relatively low resistance, the output voltage is less 
than the voltage setting, the output current is at the current setting. The supply is in 
constant-current mode and the voltage setting acts as a voltage limit.

Output Characteristics

Unregulated State
If the power supply should go into a mode of operation that is neither CV or CC, the 
power supply is unregulated. In this mode the output is not predictable. The 
unregulated condition may be the result of the ac line voltage below the specifications. 
The unregulated condition may occur momentarily. For example when the output is 
programmed for a large voltage step; the output capacitor or a large capacitive load 
will charge up at the current limit setting. During the ramp up of the output voltage 
the power supply will be in the unregulated mode. During the transition from CV to 
CC as when the output is shorted, the unregulated state may occur briefly during the 
transition.

Unwanted Signals
An ideal power supply has a perfect dc output with no signals across the terminals or 
from the terminals to earth ground. The actual power supply has finite noise across 
the output terminals, and a finite current will flow through any impedance connected 
from either terminal to earth ground. The first is called normal mode voltage noise 
and the second common mode current noise.
Normal mode voltage noise is in the form of ripple related to the line frequency plus 
some random noise. Both of these are of very low value in the Keysight E3631A. 
Careful lead layout and keeping the power supply circuitry away from power devices 
and other noise sources will keep these values low.
Common mode noise can be a problem for very sensitive circuitry that is referenced 
to earth ground. When a circuit is referenced to earth ground, a low level line--related 
ac current will flow from the output terminals to earth ground. Any impedance to 
earth ground will create a voltage drop equal to the current flow multiplied by the 
impedance. To minimize this effect, the output terminal can be grounded at the output 
terminal. Alternately, any impedances to earth ground should have a complementary 
impedance to earth ground to cancel any generated voltages. If the circuit is not 
referenced to earth ground, common mode power line noise is typically not 
a problem.
The output will also change due to changes in the load. As the load increases the 
output current will cause a small drop in the output voltage of the power supply 
due to the output impedance R. Any resistance in the connecting wire will add to 
this resistance and increase the voltage drop. Using the largest possible hook up 
wire will minimize the voltage drop.

Output Characteristics



Figure 7-6. Simplified Diagram of Common Mode and Normal Mode Sources of 
Noise

When the load changes very rapidly, as when a relay contact is closed, the inductance 
in the hook up wire and in the power supply output will cause a spike to appear at the 
load. The spike is a function of the rate of change of the load current. When very rapid 
changes in load are expected, a capacitor with a low series resistance, in parallel with 
the power supply, and close to the load is the best way to minimize these voltage 
spikes.

Connecting the Load

Connecting the Load

Output Isolation
The outputs of all three power supplies are isolated from earth ground. Any output 
terminal may be grounded, or an external voltage source may be connected between 
any terminal output and ground. However, output terminals must be kept within ±240 
Vdc of ground. The ± 25V supplies are tied together at one common terminal. Any 
one of the three terminals can be tied to ground as needed. An earth ground terminal 
is provided on the front panel for convenience.

Multiple Loads
When connecting multiple loads to the power supply, each load should be connected 
to the output terminals using separate connecting wires. This minimizes mutual 
coupling effects between loads and takes full advantage of the low output impedance 
of the power supply. Each pair of wires should be as short as possible and twisted or 
shielded to reduce lead inductance and noise pick-up. If a shield is used, connect one 
end to the power supply ground terminal and leave the other end disconnected.
If cabling considerations require the use of distribution terminals that are located 
remotely from the power supply, connect output terminals to the distribution terminals 
by a pair of twisted or shielded wires. Connect each load to the distribution terminals 
separately.

Load Consideration
Capacitive Loading
In most cases, the power supply will be stable for almost any size load capacitance. 
Large load capacitors may cause ringing in the power supply's transient response. It 
is possible that certain combinations of load capacitance, equivalent series resistance, 
and load lead inductance will result in instability. If this occurs, the problem may often 
be solved by either increasing or decreasing the total load capacitance.
A large load capacitor may cause the power supply to cross into CC or unregulated 
mode momentarily when the output voltage is reprogrammed.  The slew rate of the 
output voltage will be limited to the current setting divided by the total load 
capacitance (internal and external).

Inductive loading
Inductive loads present no loop stability problems in constant voltage mode. In 
constant current mode, inductive loads form a parallel resonance with the power 
supply’s output capacitor. Generally this will not affect the stability of the power 
supply, but it may cause ringing of the current in the load.

Pulse Loading
In some applications the load current varies periodically from a minimum to a 
maximum value. The constant current circuit limits the output current. Some peak 
loading exceeding the current limit can be obtained due to the output capacitor. To 
stay within the specifications for the output, the current limit should be set greater 
than the peak current expected or the supply may go into CC mode or unregulated 
mode for brief periods.

150



Chapter 7 Tutorial
Connecting the Load

Reverse Current Loading
An active load connected to the supply may actually deliver a reverse current to the 
supply during a portion of its operating cycle. An external source cannot be allowed 
to pump current into the supply without risking loss of regulation and possible 
damage. These effects can be avoided by preloading the output with a dummy load 
resistor. The dummy load resistor should draw at least the same amount of current 
from the supply as the active load may deliver to the supply. The value of the current 
for the dummy load plus the value of the current the load draws from the supply must 
be less than the maximum current of the supply.

151

Chapter 7 Tutorial
Extending the Voltage



Extending the Voltage

The power supply may be able to provide voltages greater than its rated maximum 
outputs if the power-line voltage is at or above its nominal value. Operation can be 
extended up to 3% over the rated output without damage to the power supply, but 
performance cannot be guaranteed to meet specifications in this region. If the power-
line voltage is maintained in the upper end of the input voltage range, the power supply 
will probably operate within its specifications. The power supply is more likely to 
stay within specifications if only one of the voltage or current outputs is exceeded.

Series Connections
Series operation of two or more power supplies can be accomplished up to the output 
isolation rating (240 Vdc) of any one supply to obtain a higher voltage than that 
available from a single supply. Series connected power supplies can be operated with 
one load across both power supplies or with a separate load for each power supply. 
The power supply has a reverse polarity diode connected across the output terminals 
so that if operated in series with other power supplies, damage will not occur if the 
load is short-circuited or if one power supply is turned on separately from its series 
partners.
When series connection is used, the output voltage is the sum of the voltages of the 
individual power supplies. The current is the current of any one power supply. Each 
of the individual power supplies must be adjusted in order to obtain the total output 
voltage.
In the Keysight E3631A the two 25V supplies can be operated in series to obtain 
one 0 - 50V supply. The power supply can be put in “Track” mode and then the output 
will be twice that shown on the front panel. The current will be that of either the + 
25V supply or the -25V supply. 

152

Chapter 7 Tutorial
Remote Programming

Remote Programming

During remote programming a constant-voltage regulated power supply is called upon 
to change its output voltage rapidly. The most important factor limiting the speed of 
output voltage change is the output capacitor and load resistor.

Figure 7-7. Speed of Response - Programming Up (Full Load)

The equivalent circuit and the nature of the output voltage waveform when the supply 
is being programmed upward are shown in Figure 7-7. When the new output is 
programmed, the power supply regulator circuit senses that the output is less than 
desired and turns on the series regulator to its maximum value IL, the current limit or 
constant current setting. 
This constant current IL charges the output capacitor CO and load resistor RL parallel. 
The output therefore rises exponentially with a time constant RLCL towards voltage 
level IL RL, a value higher than the new output voltage being programmed. 
When this exponential rise reaches the newly programmed voltage level, the 
constant voltage amplifier resumes its normal regulating action and holds the output 
constant. Thus, the rise time can be determined approximately using the formula 
shown in Figure 7-7.

7

153

Chapter 7 Tutorial
Remote Programming



If no load resistor is attached to the power supply output terminal, then the output 
voltage will rise linearly at a rate of CO/IL when programmed upward, and 
TR = CO(E2-E1)/IL, the shortest possible up-programming time.

Figure 7-8. Speed of Response -Programming Down

Figure 7-8 shows that when the power supply is programmed down, the regulator 
senses that the output voltage is higher than desired and turns off the series transistors 
entirely. Since the control circuit can in no way cause the series regulator transistors 
to conduct backwards, the output capacitor can only be discharged through the load 
resistor and internal current source (IS). 
The output voltage decays linearly with slope of IS/CO with no load and stops falling 
when it reaches the new output voltage which has been demanded. If full load is 
connected, the output voltage will fall exponentially faster.
Since up-programming speed is aided by the conduction of the series regulating 
transistor, while down programming normally has no activeelement aiding in the 
discharge of the output capacitor, laboratory power supplies normally program 
upward more rapidly than downward.

Reliability

Reliability

Reliability of electronic semiconductor equipment depends heavily on the 
temperature of the components. The lower the temperature of the components, the 
better the reliability. The Keysight E3631A incorporates circuitry to reduce the 
internal power dissipation of the power supply and therefore reduce the internal heat 
of the power supply. Maximum internal power dissipation occurs at maximum current. 
The internal power dissipation further increases as the output voltage is lowered. A 
fan internal to the Keysight  E3631A is essential to keep internal temperatures low. 
To assist in cooling the Keysight E3631A the sides and rear of the Keysight E3631A 
should be kept clear.
